Our project is included in a larger one. The main purpose is to determine a person’s emotions
from physiological or biological data. Our project was aimed at recovering a person’s cardiac
data. These data are recorded from two connected bracelets: FitBit Charge 2 and Samsung Gear
Fit 2. Afterwards, the collected data are sent by a Bluetooth protocol to the main application,
then the data are displayed under a graphic form.
